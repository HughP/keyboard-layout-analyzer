## Known issues

It's been a long time since I've made any significant changes to this project. While getting it ready to setup on github I noticed the minfication for the JS didn't work. I'm not currently using it, so I've left it broken.

Additionally, this project was written when I was learning Angular, so I put a lot of logic in controller functions which should go in link functions. 

This project isn't at the state I'd want it to be for a release, but every couple of months I get an email about the code, and if I wait unless I'm happy with it I'll be waiting forever.
